% *** Authors should verify (and, if needed, correct) their LaTeX system  ***
% *** with the testflow diagnostic prior to trusting their LaTeX platform ***
% *** with production work. IEEE's font choices can trigger bugs that do  ***

% The testflow support page is at:
% http://www.michaelshell.org/tex/testflow/




% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
% The Computer Society usually requires 10pt for submissions.
%
\documentclass[10pt,journal,cspaper,compsoc]{IEEEtran}
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[12pt,journal,compsoc]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  % \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  % \usepackage{cite}
\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later. Note also the use of a CLASSOPTION conditional provided by
% IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later.





% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%\usepackage[tight,normalsize,sf,SF]{subfigure}
%\else
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
%\fi
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. Computer Society papers
% use a larger font and \sffamily font for their captions, hence the
% additional options needed under compsoc mode. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%  \usepackage[font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%  \usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley and Jeff Goldberg.
% This package may be useful when used in conjunction with IEEEtran.cls'
% captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that submissions
% have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.3.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% For subfigure.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfigure\subfigure
% \renewcommand{\subfigure}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfigure[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat/subfig command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!

% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,

\begin{abstract}
%\boldmath
We primarily address the usage of cached Database query results in our paper.
This problem was already discussed and has some software implementations. In our
work, we propose Truth spaces usage in logical formulas while querying a Database.
This approach is supposed to help an analyst, who works with dynamically built
data representations logically described as multidimensional tables. Those
representations don't take much disk space, so one can use GPU to speed up the
computations. We consider queries in a form of relational algebra expressions,
similar to "universal relational query". Logical formulas in the queries are
presented in Disjunctive Normal Form. They consist of atomic expressions
consisting of SQL predicates. In the paper we consider single and multiple table
cases to build new data representations.
\end{abstract}
% IEEEtran.cls defaults to using nonbold math in the Abstract.
% This preserves the distinction between vectors and scalars. However,
% if the journal you are submitting to favors bold math in the abstract,
% then you can use LaTeX's standard command \boldmath at the very start
% of the abstract to achieve this. Many IEEE journals frown on math
% in the abstract anyway. In particular, the Computer Society does
% not want either math or citations to appear in the abstract.

% To allow for easy dual compilation without having to reenter the

\section{Introduction}
% Computer Society journal papers do something a tad strange with the very
% first section heading (almost always called "Introduction"). They place it
% ABOVE the main text! IEEEtran.cls currently does not do this for you.
% However, You can achieve this effect by making LaTeX jump through some
% hoops via something like:
%
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \noindent\raisebox{2\baselineskip}[0pt][0pt]%
%  {\parbox{\columnwidth}{\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}%
%  \global\everypar=\everypar}}%
%  \vspace{-1\baselineskip}\vspace{-\parskip}\par
%\else
%  \section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}\par
%\fi
%
% Admittedly, this is a hack and may well be fragile, but seems to do the
% trick for me. Note the need to keep any \label that may be used right
% after \section in the above as the hack puts \section within a raised box.



% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps (small caps for compsoc).
% 
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:

\IEEEPARstart{A}{lot} of current Big Data analysis solutions use Online
Analytical Processing technologies, formed in early 90s \cite{codd}. Many
fundamental \cite{lecht,lehner,mazon} and applied \cite{vassi, peder,
progressive, giorg} results were obtained in this field lately.

The purpose of this paper is to study the problem of building Dynamic
Multidimensional Data Representation from the Relational Database using
cached data representations on a user computer, equipped with a Graphical
Processing Unit (GPU). We don't require any transformation of the initial
Database schema, even to the hierarchical model.

This problem is connected with a field of query optimization, because it aims to
decrease the data transfer from a Database server. Cached data is actively
used in Database Management Systems (DBMS), but mostly, it is only repeating use
of data, written in cache, without any prior data analysis to define any partial
or combined use. The DBMS can only avoid requesting blocks of data from external
devices while serving the query, if they are present in the cache. So, the
block numbers are analyzed, not their information.

This paper is based on the results, obtained in \cite{zyk_pol}. We removed
condition that limited Intermediate Data Representation (IDR) attributes and
also made some generalizations on multiple IDRs case.

\section{Existing solutions overview and comparison}
In a field of fundamental researches, huge amounts of publications aim at optimal
query plan generation based on a formal set of rules that don't use SQL
operator predicate domains (logical optimization). In other cases, those domains
are taken into account for statistical evaluations to improve physical access to
the data. Stream data query executing problems, described in \cite{Olston03,
Denny05}, are related to our problem closer, but different aims lead us to
different results. The most similar to our work is paper \cite{Afrati06}. They
analyze conjunctive queries on data domains with predicates in the form of
arithmetical comparisons, and present query computation algorithms using IDRs. In
our paper, the special case of universal relational query is considered. It is a
query on the Database relations, not particular domains. Although we had similar
aims, the results obtained differ because of stated factors. In particular,
there is no need to create any algorithms of data selection in our work, as they
are replaced by Relational Algebra.

There are some works, which examine the query optimization problem in the case of
multidimensional warehouse representation with the use of dynamically formed
representations. Two basic methods are used there: statical \cite{baralis,
gupta, gupta-mumick} and dynamical one \cite{scheuermann, shim, kalnis, chang}.
The former is based on a fixed amount of queries, whereas in the latter queries
for reservation are chosen based on appearance statistic and computational cost
of query execution. As a data source Data Warehouses or Relational Databases in
the hierarchical form are used. Special queries for data manipulation are
considered. In this paper we use split dimension generation for the data
required for current analysis. Hence, we are interested in standard SQL queries
to the Database and IDRs. The resulting representation can then be processed by
special multidimensional data queries.

In the \cite{Keller96} paper, they analyze the cache content,
and predicates in their work correspond to IDRs in our approach. Cached data
usage problem is resolved in terms of predicate deduction. In our paper, we address this problem by means of
computation of cached query results domains that correspond to the IDRs. It allows
us to define IR records that can be used to form a new representation and new SQL
queries that will let us load missing data from Database server. The following
example demonstrates suggested approach.


{\bf Example 1.} The task is to receive data representation as in the table
\ref{def_T_1}. Dimension attributes are in bold, measure attributes are italic,
else are attribute values.

Assume the precomputed relations on the user PC:  $P_1$,
$P_2$, $P_3$ with the following schemes: $P_1$=(Department number, Department),
without any data constraints; $P_2$=(Discipline number, Discipline), without
data constraints; $P_3$=(Department number, Discipline number, Semester, Class,
Hours), with the following constraint: $F_3 =(\mbox{Semester} \leq 2) \wedge
(\mbox{Department} = \mbox{D. of Chemistry})$. Assume the user has made the
following logical constraint on the data to be represented in the table:
$F^{\ast} = (\mbox{Semester} \leq 3)$. Comparing these formulas domains, it's
easy to see that $P_1$ and $P_2$ have enough data to form table \ref{def_T_1},
whereas $P_3$ needs to be expanded with data. After defining $F^{\ast}$ and
$F_3$ domains we can form a new formula: $F=((\mbox{Semester} = 3) \wedge
(\mbox{Deparmtent=D. of Chemistry})) \vee ((\mbox{Semester} \leq 3) \wedge
(\mbox{Deparmtent} \neq \mbox{D. of Chemistry}))$. Using $P_3$ schema and $F$
formula, we can now make an SQL command to be executed on the server. As a
result, we transfer less data over the network.

\section{Logical constraint definition and properties}

To simplify domain computations we will consider logical formulas in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF).
In general case formula $F$ has the following form:

\begin{equation}
F = K_1 \vee K_2 \vee \dots \vee K_m ,
\label{def_F_1}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
K_i = T_1 \& T_2 \dots \& T_n, i = 1, \dots, m ,
\label{def_F_2}
\end{equation}
here $T_j, j = 1, \dots, n$ - predicates, where expanded attribute names are specified. $R_i.A_j$ means attribute $A_j$ in relation $R_i$.
Those predicates can be:
\begin{itemize}
  \item	comparison operation $ \n{Expr}_1 \theta \n{Expr}_2$, $\theta$ ?
  comparison operator $(\theta \in \{=, \neq, >, <, \leq, \geq\})$, $\n{Expr}_i$
  ? type conformant expressions, defined in a space of expanded attribute names and constants;
  \item operation $\n{Expr}_1 \n{[NOT]} \n{BETWEEN} \n{Expr}_2 \n{AND}
  \n{Expr}_3$ (symbols inside square brackets $[*]$ aren't mandatory for the predicate);
  \item operation $\n{Expr} \n{[NOT]} \n{IN} S$, here $S$ ? values list or subquery, having a set of attribute $R_i.A_j$ values as a result;
  \item operation $\n{Str}_1 \n{[NOT]} \n{LIKE} \n{Str}_2$, here $\n{Str}_i$ ?
  strings;
  \item operation $\n{Expr} \theta \n{ALL/ANY} S$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{note}
We assume logical formulas have no trivial conditions on attributes, for example
, $Expr_1 = Expr_1$ and those reduced to such form. In general, we assume that
$R_i.A_l$ domain is not fully contained in $T_j (\dots , R_i . A_l ,\dots )$
predicate truth space. Such conditions can be removed from the formula without a
change in the truth space (we will define it later).
\label{trivial}
\end{note}

\begin{mydef}
Space of attributes contained in a formula show the dimension of the formula and
is denoted as $\<F> $.

\begin{equation}
\<F> = \{R_1^F.A_1^F, \dots, R_k^F.A_k^F\}
\label{def_F_3}
\end{equation}
\end{mydef}


Listed variants of operations don't use every single SQL capability. For example
, we don't use $\n{EXISTS}$ predicate, because it has no expanded attribute
names in it. $\n{NULL}$ predicate is used for another purpose in our paper.

During logical formula domain calculation if we have some attribute having
$NULL$ value on a row $t$, we then get the $\n{UNKNOWN}$ value for the whole
formula, because SQL-query results follow the Three-valued logic. It leads us to
ambiguous interpretations of result of both usual users and experienced
programmers. To solve this problem we suggest the following constraint: every
attribute in $F^{\ast}$ is supplied with a property ``Use of undefined value''
with two mutually exclusive values: ``Yes'' or ``No''. The reasoning behind
this property is the following: if it is assigned ``Yes'', then we leave rows
with $\n{NULL}$ value for further consideration. Otherwise, having ``No'' in
that property guarantees us removing all such rows.

Let's write expression (\ref{def_F_1}) for $F$ in the following form: $ F (\dots
, T_j , \dots )$, here $T_j$ - predicates of expression (\ref{def_F_2}).
Then after the modification it will be the following: 
$F( \dots, T'_j , \dots )\wedge_{i,j}(R_i .A_j \neq  \n{NULL})$, here
$\wedge_{i,j}(R_i .A_j \neq  \n{NULL})$ - conjunction of all $F$ attributes,for
which $\n{NULL}$ is not allowed, and $T'_j = (T_j \vee_{i,j}(R_i .A_j =
\n{NULL}))$, here  $\vee_{i,j}(R_i .A_j = \n{NULL})$ - disjunction of all $F$
attributes, for which $\n{NULL}$ is allowed. Outer brackets for $T'_j$ predicate
define operation priority. We can see that this logical formula can only have
$\n{TRUE}$ and $\n{FALSE}$ values when considering it in Three-valued logic. We
also can note that if rows don't have undefined values, the initial formula $F$
will be equivalent to the transformed one. There can be some cases when the
meaning of $P$ IR changes with such a transformation. For example, assume $F =
R_1 .A_2 > 3 \vee R_3 .A_4 < 4$. Let row $t$ has $R_1 .A_2$ value set to
$\n{NULL}$, with a property ``Use of undefined value'' set to ``Yes'', and $R_3
.A_4$ value set to 5, so $R_3 .A_4 < 4$ predicate is $\n{FALSE}$. Then $F$
transformation on $t$ row will be $\n{TRUE}$, what is not so obvious indeed.

Hereafter we will suppose all the $F$ formulas to be transformed.

We consider $\mathcal{A} =$ $\{(a_1, \dots, a_n)
\mid a_i \in Dom(A_i), i=1,\dots,n\}$ set, here $Dom(A_i)$ - is a domain of
$A_i$. Cartesian product $Dom(A_1)\times Dom(A_2)\times \dots \times Dom(A_n)$
is an $n$-dimensional space of all values for all Database attributes. Data
constraints bound this space to some set of points that represents available
Database states. In the Note \ref{trivial} we consider the whole space, not only
the available states.

\begin{mydef}
Truth space of logical formula $F$, defined by (\ref{def_F_1}),
(\ref{def_F_2}), (\ref{def_F_3}), is a set $M (F) = \{a \in \mathcal{A} \mid
F(a) = \n {TRUE}\}$.
\end{mydef}

\begin{note}
$F$ formula dimension can be smaller than $\mathcal{A}$ dimension. In this case
attributes that aren't presented in formula can take any values in their
domains.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
The complexity of $\n{Expr}$, $S$ and $\n{Str}$ predicates is defined by
software ability to compute Truth spaces of formulas, as it is shown in example
1.
\end{note}

We now see how Truth space operations can be handled with respect to the
corresponding formulas. $M (F)$ for a given formula $F$, written in DNF, is
nothing but a union of Truth spaces of distinct conjunctive clauses. Truth space
of a single conjunctive clause is an intersection of Truth spaces of it's
predicates.

\begin{mydef}
Given a logical formula $F$, defined by (\ref{def_F_1}), (\ref{def_F_2}),
(\ref{def_F_3}), the projection of $F$ on the $X$ attribute set is a logical
formula $F[X], \<F[X]> = X$, that has all its predicates with $R_i^F.A_i^F
\notin X$ replaced with trivial predicate $\n{TRUE}$.
\label{projection}
\end{mydef}

\begin{statement}[Inclusion property]
$\forall X \subseteq \<F> \quad M(F) \subseteq M(F[X])$
\label{proj_property_of_inclusion}
\end{statement}
\begin{proof}
If $X = \<F> $, then $F = F[X]$ and $M(F) = M(F[X])$. Assume $X \subset \<F> $.
Consider arbitrary point $a \in M(F)$, i.e. $F(a)=\n{TRUE}$. $F$ to $F[X]$
transformation is made by replacing $T_j$ predicates that contain $A_j \in \<F> 
$ attribute, such that $A_j \notin X$ with $\n{TRUE}$ value. We get
$F([X])=\n{TRUE}$ according to (\ref{def_F_1}) and (\ref{def_F_2}). Therefore,
$a \in M(F[X])$.
\end{proof}

This property of logical formulas is used while building new data representation
from given IDRs.

\section{Intermediate Data Representation properties research}

We denote saved IDRs as $P$=$\{ P_1$, $P_2$, $\dots$, $P_m \}$, here $P_v =
\pi_{X_v}(\sigma_{F_v} (R^v_1 \Join R^v_2 \Join \dots \Join R^v_{s(v)} ))$,
$s(v)$ ? amount of relations in Database that were used while building $P_v$
IDR, $\pi_{X_v}$ - projection on $X_v$ attributes, $\sigma_{F_v}$ - selection
with $F_v$ logical formula. We need to get the following representation out of
$P$ IDRs: $$P^{\ast} = \pi_{X^{\ast}}(\sigma_{F^{\ast}} (R^{\ast}_1 \Join
R^{\ast}_2\Join\dots \Join R^{\ast}_l )$$

Lets study the problem of building data representation $P^{\ast}$ using existing
$P_v$ IDRs.

\input{theorem_1}

The conditions given in theorem guarantee the data to build $P^{\ast}$ to be
contained in $P_v$ IDR. However, there can be excess rows that make $F^{\ast}$
take $\n{TRUE}$ value. They appear because there are some relations in
$R^{\ast}_1 \Join R^{\ast}_2\Join \dots \Join R^{\ast}_l $ that aren't
presented in $R^v_1 \Join R^v_2 \Join \dots \Join R^v_{s(v)} $ and will be
deleted if we join those missing relations. Using Truth spaces of logical
formulas we can query DBMS to get a minimal required data set to define excess
rows.

In the next theorem we describe the case of coinciding relation sets.

\input{theorem_2}

It is possible to use several IRs to build resulting representation. At first,
let's consider the following simple property of natural join.

\begin{statement}
Assume $\Re_1 = R_1 \Join \dots \Join R_k$ - natural join of some $k$ relations.
Also assume $\Re_2 = R_1 \Join \dots \Join R_k \Join R_{k+1} \Join \dots \Join
R_{n}$. Then $\Re_2 [\langle \Join_{i=1}^{k} R_i \rangle] \subseteq \Re_1$
\label{join_property}
\end{statement}
\begin{proof}
It is so indeed, because joining additional relations to $\Re_1$ can only
remove some rows that were presented there. After the projection, we will get
the same relation $\Re_1$ if no rows were deleted or some subset otherwise. The
order of joins doesn't matter thanks to commutativity property of this
operation.
\end{proof}

\input{theorem_1_mult}

Just like in previous case, there are some additional conditions that allow us
to get precise data presentation from IRs.

\input{theorem_2_mult}

The conditions listed above aren't exceptional in any case, because the set of
dimensions that form hypercube changes rarely, so we can create new dimensions
(data representations) from IRs with much less DB interaction.

\section{Conclusion}
The prime result of our paper is the justification of IR usage conditions for
new hypercube creation. Those IRs can be stored on an analyst's PC and
drastically shorten the time of getting the required data.

The common problem of systems that don't use any DBMS is the data refreshing. In
MOLAP approach, the technical support staff is responsible for periodical
refreshing of data. The same method can be used to refresh $P_v$
representations. The access to the DMBS's DB modification log and refreshing
only modified data decreases the refresh time period. However, let's notice
again that those dimensions don't change often.

We assume the usage of GPU to implement intermediate filtration and union of
different data representations. The research in this field shows that GPU
operations are much faster than those on CPU for small data. There is a decrease
in performance with data scale. The reason is obvious: big amount of data leads
to a much more frequent data transfer between different memory types and
increases the overall time elapsed. But the constant GPU memory growth and the
fact that data amount required for multidimensional data dimensions building is
comparatively small make the usage of graphical processors quite a good choice
for these purposes.
